# Password Generator

## Description: 

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include:
* Special characters.
* Lowercase.
* Uppercase. 
* Numeric.
* The length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
